# Final_Mini_Project

## Overview
Your client has launched a pop-up café in a busy business district.\
They are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices.\
As such, they require a software application which helps them to log and track orders.
## Requirements
As a business:\
• I want to maintain a collection of products and couriers.\
• When a customer makes a new order, I need to create this on the system.\
• I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e: preparing, out-for-delivery, delivered.\
• When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.\
• When I start my app, I need to load all persisted data.\
• I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.\
• I need to receive regular software updates.
## User Interface
You will be building a program that runs on the command line (CLI).\
• UI should be logical, clear, and simple to navigate.\
• It should display a menu of options, some may be nested.\
• There should be the option to exit / return to main menu.\
• It should handle invalid input.
## Data Persistence
You will incrementally adopt three methods to persist data between user sessions:\
• txt: Initially we'll store our data in plaintext files.\
• csv: As our data changes shape, we'll need to switch to the CSV format.\
• SQL: Ultimately, we'll finish up using a database.

## Brief of the code
In this project I use python and sql to meet the client requirement.\
In SQL I create database contains product_list, courier, customers, order, order_item columns, which allow the user to insert, present and manipulate the data.\
In Pythin I creat defferent function to make the user inter the data they need to creat a new products, courier, customers and order.\
In addition the data will save in the database. so, the user can keep it safe and they can show the data and return to it in any time.\
All this done by connecting Python with SQL.\
\
## What did you most enjoy implementing?
In this Mini Project I started my first step to meet my passion about the data engineering.\
And give me an idea about the power of python and sql, and how it is we can create and keep the data safe and manipulate it.
